**Abstract:**
With the continuous development of edge computing and IIoT technology, there are growing types of IIoT devices, and the number of such devices is continuously climbing. It is indispensable to authenticate devices in the IIoT environment. In this paper, we propose two blockchain-based authentication for IIoT devices with PUF. The first one relies on SRAM PUF, which is highly compatible with physical devices and has low cost. For the second one, we utilize the property of Arbiter PUF that it is difficult to physically clone but easy to be cloned mathematically to build the PUF models for authentication. We protect CRPs used for model training from leakage, and prevent PUF from being modeled twice. We formalize the security properties, and we prove that our proposal is secure. Besides, our proposal achieves scalability, which means that the entities involved in the scheme authenticate the devices instead of storing amounts of CRPs. Finally, we take SVM as an example to model PUF, and the implementation results demonstrate that the PUF model could achieve the accuracy of 99.9%. In addition, we implement smart contracts, and the implementation results confirm the availability of the protocol in the IIoT environment.
